# FD-Mode-Solver
Finite difference Mode Solver for TE/TM E- and/or H-fields in optical waveguide structures with arbitrary index profile. Calculation scheme is based on a semi-vectorial finite difference approach utilizing an absorbing boundary condition.

For further reference with respect to the numerical implementation please refer to appropriate literature. And excellent and comprehensive work is the book 'Introduction to Optical Waveguide Analysis: Solving Maxwell's Equations and the Schr√∂dinger Equation' by K. Kawano and T. Kitoh.

I implemented this mode solver during my time as a PhD student to complement my finite difference based Beam Propagation Method (BPM) for the excitation of optical waveguide structures with a specific mode.

The code is likely not to be maintained or supported to any extent in the future.
